Dear Ether Thinker / User / Account-Holder / BFF,

We just had someone (presumably you) plug your email address into the 'I forgot my password'
page on http://theEther.info, indicating that your password needs to get reset so you can 
log in again. We would just <i>tell</i> you what your password is, but since it's stored 
in an encrypted format, we're frankly as clueless as you are.
Though if we had to hazard a guess, we'd say it was either "muffintop1865" or "BriscoCountyJr".

Anyway, just go to this address and you'll be prompted to enter in a new password to overwrite your old one.

http://theEther.info/reset_password/<?php echo $user_id; ?>/<?php echo $reset_password_hash; ?>

NOTE: That link will only work for the rest of <?php echo date('F Y'); ?>. That's so if some creep finds this
email later on, they won't be able to use it to get into your account.

Love, 
Ether
