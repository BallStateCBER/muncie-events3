			Dear Ether Thinker / User / Account-Holder / BFF,
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We just had someone (presumably you) plug your email address into the 'I forgot my password'
			page on <a href="http://theEther.info">http://theEther.info</a>, indicating that your password needs to get reset so you can 
			log in again. We would just <i>tell</i> you what your password is, but since it's stored 
			in an encrypted format, we're frankly as clueless as you are.
			Though if we had to hazard a guess, we'd say it was either "muffintop1865" or "BriscoCountyJr".
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Anyway, just click on this link and you'll be prompted to enter in a new password to overwrite your old one.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="http://theEther.info/reset_password/<?php echo $user_id; ?>/<?php echo $reset_password_hash; ?>">
				http://theEther.info/reset_password/<?php echo $user_id; ?>/<?php echo $reset_password_hash; ?>
			</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>NOTE: That link will only work for the rest of <?php echo date('F Y'); ?>.</strong> 
			That's so if some creep finds this email later on, they won't be able to use it to get into your account.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Love,
			<br />
