		<strong>Adult-Oriented Events</strong>: Any events of a sexual nature or with any other content 
		inappropriate for an audience under 18 years of age must include the 'adult-oriented' tag so

		<strong>Formatting</strong>: An event's title should not redundantly include 
		information entered into other fields, such as location name, address, cost, or age
		restrictions. Using CAPS LOCK FOR EMPHASIS and other obnoxiously-formatted text 
		(administrators' discretion) is not allowed.
